The Maternal Health App is a Flask-based web application that provides reliable and easy-to-read maternal health information using an external API. It helps users access curated knowledge about pregnancy, prenatal care, and related topicsâ€”organized into titles, subtitles, summaries, and visuals for better understanding. Key features include fetching and displaying real maternal health data, clean UI with Bootstrap, robust error handling, and full Docker containerization for easy deployment. To run it locally, clone the repo, create a virtual environment, install dependencies from requirements.txt, and run main.py. The app will be available at http://localhost:8080. For Docker users, build the image using docker build -t sandoo17/maternalapp:v1 ., run it with docker run -p 8080:8080 sandoo17/maternalapp:v1, and test with curl http://localhost:8080. To push the image to Docker Hub, use docker login, then docker push sandoo17/maternalapp:v1. On the lab servers (Web01 and Web02), pull the image and run it with docker run -d --name maternal-app --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 sandoo17/maternalapp:v1. On the load balancer (Lb01), edit /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg to include both servers in the backend using balance roundrobin, then reload HAProxy using docker exec -it lb-01 sh -c 'haproxy -sf $(pidof haproxy) -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg'. Test the load balancing with repeated curl http://localhost calls to see traffic alternate between Web01 and Web02. For secret management, create a .env file with your API_KEY, access it using os.getenv("API_KEY") in Python, and add .env to .gitignore. This project uses public maternal health content APIs (link should be provided), and a demo video showcasing usage and load balancing can be found here: [insert video link]. The app meets all functionality, deployment, user interaction, and documentation criteria required by the assignment.
